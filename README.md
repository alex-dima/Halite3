# Details regarding the algorithmic approach
Using a Greedy approach we sort the possibilities on a weighted average formed from the difference
of halite between any 2 cells, with 0.5 weight and the cartesian difference of the cells position. This way
we manage to obtain a compromise between distance and the halite obtained
